# Loan Calculator Via Hooks

This project focuses on calculating interest amount and monthly payments based on inputs provided by the user.

The project comprises of the following core libraries:

1. React: Managing local state, structuring and building code via JSX, and finally building it using the webpack config provided by create-react-app.
2. Antd: All the design components like the slider and inputs are being imported through this library.
3. Axios: For performing GET request on the API.
4. React-Animation: To display the output in a more user-friendly manner.

You can try it yourself using the the following steps:

1. Close the repository.
2. yarn/npm install.
3. yarn start/ npm run start (This will open up the project via the development webpack config with HMR support)
4. To use a production build: yarn build/npm run build, which will create a build directory and you can serve it using any of the serve libraries.

P.S. This is one of my very few design attemps, I usually work with a web designer.
